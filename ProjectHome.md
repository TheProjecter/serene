# Serene Project #

<br>

The purpose of this project is to create an open source validation engine that implements the JAXP 1.3 Validation Framework API for RELAX NG based on an algorithm centered on providing good messages and having a clear handling of ambiguity and conflicts. An implementation of the JAXP Validation Framework API for ISO Schematron and support for Schematron markup embedded in RELAX NG schemas have been added.<br>
