==Serene 0.5.1==

This release supports the vendor independent API for RELAX NG datatype libraries developed by James Clark and Kohsuke Kawaguchi, {{{org.relaxng.datatypes}}}, so you can create your own libraries, pack them as jar files adding the necessary {{{META-INF/services/org.relaxng.datatype.DatatypeLibraryFactory}}}  file containing the names of your service providers for the {{{org.relaxng.datatype.DatatypeLibraryFactory}}} service, add them in the classpath, and they will be found dynamically at runtime. See samples for an example. 

External datatypes may use param elements, but it is their responsibility to implement the [http://www.oasis/open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html#constraints Relax NG Simplification 4.16.Constraints] rule. See samples source code for an example.
