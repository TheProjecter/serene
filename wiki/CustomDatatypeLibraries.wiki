Serene 0.5 supports the vendor independent API for RELAX NG datatype libraries developed by James Clark and Kohsuke Kawaguchi, {{{org.relaxng.datatypes}}}, so you can create your own libraries, pack them as jar files adding the necessary {{{META-INF/services/org.relaxng.datatype.DatatypeLibraryFactory}}}  file containing the names of your service providers for the {{{org.relaxng.datatype.DatatypeLibraryFactory}}} service, add them in the classpath, and they will be found dynamically at runtime. See samples for an example.
