==Serene 0.6.3==

In this stage of the development there are still some limitations:

 * overlapping name classes in {{{attribute}}}s or {{{element}}}s in the context of a {{{group}}} that has multiple cardinality and is in the context of an {{{interleave}}} are not supported. Example: 

{{{
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <start>
       <element name = "root">
         <interleave>
           <oneOrMore>
               <element name = "aa">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
               <element name = "bb">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
               <element name = "aa">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
           </oneOrMore>
           <element name = "cc">
             <empty/>
           </element>
         </interleave>
       </element>
     </start>
   </grammar>
}}}

Attempting to use such a schema configuration would result in an error message similar to those issued when a restriction rule is violated. 

 * {{{group}}} or {{{interleave}}} with multiple cardinality in the context of an {{{interleave}}} with multiple cardinality are not supported. Example: 

{{{
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <start>
       <element name = "root">
         <oneOrMore>
           <interleave>
             <oneOrMore>
               <element name = "aa">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
               <element name = "bb">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
             </oneOrMore>
             <element name = "cc">
               <empty/>
             </element>
           </interleave>
         </oneOrMore>
       </element>
     </start>
   </grammar>
}}}

Attempting to use such a schema configuration would result in an error message similar to those issued when a restriction rule is violated. 

 * {{{empty}}} in the context of {{{attribute}}}  is not supported. Example: 

{{{
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <start>
       <element name = "root">         
         <attribute name = "attribute">
           <empty/>
         </attribute>
       </element>
     </start>
   </grammar>
}}}

Attempting to use such a schema configuration would result in an error message similar to those issued when a restriction rule is violated. 

 * compact syntax is not supported. 

===Note on XML Schema Datatypes Implementation===

The XML Schema datatypes are implemented by wrapping Apache Xerces2 Java. It comes with version 2.10.0 which has the following limitations:

 * length, minLength, and maxLength facets are limited to the value 2147483647. Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly.
 * The values of minimum and maximum quantifiers in the pattern regular expressions are limited to the value 2147483647. Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly.
 * The absolute values of the fraction portion of the second values in date/time datatypes are limited to the value 2147483647. Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly. i.e. 11.2147483648 is not supported as a second value.
 * Leap seconds are not supported in the values of date/time datatypes.

Also in the original XML Schema recommendation, the lexical space of the simple type gMonth is --MM--. An erratum E2-12 changed that to --MM. For compatibility reasons, Xerces currently supports both forms. To align with the recommendation, the old form is deprecated, and support for that form is planed to be discontinued in a future release.
