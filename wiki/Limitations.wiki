In this stage of the development there are several important limitations:

 * only the RELAX NG native datatypes are supported 

 * DTD compatibility is not supported 

 * overlapping name classes in {{{attribute}}}s or {{{element}}}s in the context of a {{{group}}} that has multiple cardinality and is in the context of an {{{interleave}}} are not supported. Example: 

{{{
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <start>
       <element name = "root">
         <interleave>
           <oneOrMore>
               <element name = "aa">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
               <element name = "bb">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
               <element name = "aa">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
           </oneOrMore>
           <element name = "cc">
             <empty/>
           </element>
         </interleave>
       </element>
     </start>
   </grammar>
}}}

Attempting to use such a schema configuration would result in an error message similar to those issued when a restriction rule is violated. 

 * {{{group}}} or {{{interleave}}} with multiple cardinality in the context of an {{{interleave}}} with multiple cardinality are not supported. Example: 

{{{
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <start>
       <element name = "root">
         <oneOrMore>
           <interleave>
             <oneOrMore>
               <element name = "aa">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
               <element name = "bb">
                 <empty/>
               </element>
             </oneOrMore>
             <element name = "cc">
               <empty/>
             </element>
           </interleave>
         </oneOrMore>
       </element>
     </start>
   </grammar>
}}}

Attempting to use such a schema configuration would result in an error message similar to those issued when a restriction rule is violated. 

 * {{{empty}}} in the context of {{{attribute}}}  is not supported. Example: 

{{{
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0">
     <start>
       <element name = "root">         
         <attribute name = "attribute">
           <empty/>
         </attribute>
       </element>
     </start>
   </grammar>
}}}

Attempting to use such a schema configuration would result in an error message similar to those issued when a restriction rule is violated. 

 * compact syntax is not supported.
