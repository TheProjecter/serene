== Issue reporting ==


Please feel welcome to report any issue that might arise, it is one of the most valuable contributions to the development. Before reporting please try to make sure that the issue is really a new issue by checking the Issue Tracker, if you are still not sure start a discussion on the user mailing list.

For effective reporting please make sure the *Summary* is short but precise and descriptive, and the *Description* provides a detailed image of the problem. If the issue is a bug, the description should contain enough information to allow the reproduction of the bug. If the issue is recorded after a mailing list discussion, please include a pointer to the discussion in the description. If you are interested in seeing a particular issue resolved please star it. Use comments only for providing additional information.


== Source Code ==


There are two ways you can help with the source code: reviewing existing code and sending new patches. The Google Code Review Tool is set to allow anybody to add review comments to the code. Sending patches can by done by email using the developer list. If there are any questions, please ask them on the developer list. No effort will be spared to answer them and all contributions will be appreciated.
