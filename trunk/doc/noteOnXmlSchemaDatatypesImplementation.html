    <P>
        The XML Schema datatypes are implemented by wrapping Apache Xerces2 
        Java. It comes with version 2.10.0 which has the following limitations:
    </P>
    <P>       
        <UL>
            <LI> 
                length, minLength, and maxLength facets are limited to the value 
                2147483647. Items larger than this limit will not be validated 
                correctly.
            </LI>

            <LI> 
                The values of minimum and maximum quantifiers in the pattern
                regular expressions are limited to the value 2147483647.
                Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The absolute values of the fraction portion of the second values
                in date/time datatypes are limited to the value 2147483647.
                Items larger than this limit will not be validated correctly.
                i.e. 11.2147483648 is not supported as a second value. 
            </LI>
            <LI> 
                Leap seconds are not supported in the values of date/time datatypes.
            </LI>
        </UL>
    </P>
    <P>
        Also in the original XML Schema recommendation, the lexical space of the 
        simple type gMonth is --MM--. An erratum E2-12 changed that to --MM. For 
        compatibility reasons, Xerces currently supports both forms. To align with 
        the recommendation, the old form is deprecated, and support for that form 
        is planed to be discontinued in a future release.
