        For this release the testing was limited. The test cases used can
        be found in the testSuite/ directory which contains the actual
        schemas and documents used for testing as well as plain text files
        containing the error messages that have been accepted as correct,
        which can be used for regression testing. 
    </P>
    <P>
        <B>Serene 0.5.2 </B>includes a command line tool that allows you to
        run the tests yourself either directly by using sereneTest.jar and
        the -jar option
    </P>
    <P>
        <CODE>$ java -jar <I>path</I>/sereneTest.jar <I>path</I>/testSuite/tests</CODE>
    </P>
    <P>
        or by using the <CODE>sereneTest.Driver</CODE> class which contains the 
        main method
    </P>
    <P>
        <CODE>$ java -cp <I>path</I>/sereneTest.jar sereneTest.Driver 
        <I>path</I>/testSuite/tests</CODE>
    </P>
    <P>
        You can see the usage instructions and
        the list of available options by invoking the tool without any
        arguments.
