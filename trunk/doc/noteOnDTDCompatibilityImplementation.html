    <H1>Note on DTD Compatibility Implementation</H1>

    <P>
        The implementation of the DTD compatibility features is independent from 
        the validation implementation and it is possible to control which 
        features and levels are to be processed from the command line or through 
        the <CODE>setFeature(String name, boolean value)</CODE> methods of the 
        JAXP validation API. Furthermore, when a schema document contains errors 
        with impact on the DTD compatibility handling, implementations of the 
        abstract class <CODE>serene.SereneRecoverableException</CODE> extending 
        <CODE>org.xml.sax.SAXParseException</CODE> are used, so that they can be 
        caught separately and the features set in the 
        <CODE>javax.xml.validation.ValidatorHandler</CODE> and
        <CODE>javax.xml.validation.Validator</CODE> can be adjusted. Concrete 
        implementations are:        
    </P>
    <P>       
        <UL>
            <LI> 
                <CODE>serene.dtdcompatibility.AttributeDefaultValueException</CODE>
                for attribute default values
            </LI>
            <LI> 
                <CODE>serene.dtdcompatibility.AttributeIdTypeException</CODE>
                for attributes of type ID, IDREF, IDREFS 
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <CODE>serene.dtdcompatibility.DocumentationElementException</CODE>
                for documentation elements 
            </LI>
        </UL>
    </P>
    <P>
        Even when the compatibility property does not hold for one of the features, 
        this allows the schema to still be safely used for validation and the 
        other compatibility features.
    </P>
    <P>
        It is the client's responsibility to ensure that the errors are caught in 
        an appropriate manner and the right features are set. When attempting to 
        create an instance of <CODE>javax.xml.validation.ValidatorHandler</CODE> or
        <CODE>javax.xml.validation.Validator</CODE> an <CODE>IllegalStateException</CODE>
        is thrown if schema document contained errors that made it impossible to
        support a certain feature and that feature is set to <CODE>true</CODE>.
        When attempting to set to <CODE>true</CODE> a feature in the 
        <CODE>javax.xml.validation.ValidatorHandler</CODE> or
        <CODE>javax.xml.validation.Validator</CODE> an 
        <CODE>org.xml.sax.SAXNotSupportedException</CODE> is thrown if schema 
        document contained errors that made it impossible to
        support that feature or if corresponding level 1 features were not
        set in the <CODE>javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory</CODE>.
    </P>

        For attribute default values, the specification requires that "the value 
        of the a:defaultValue attribute matches the pattern contained in 
        the attribute element", but it is not clear if the soundness relation for 
        the ID, IDREF, IDREFS should be regarded as part of the pattern. I chose 
        to check during the compatibility property control, provided apropriate
        features were set, if this relashionship holds, but only issue warnings.
        The reason for this is that there are many situations where the document
        can be correct even if the default values used in the schema would result 
        in errors, but if error messages were to be issued, than, according to the 
        general strategy described above, the client should have to unset the 
        features and not continue the compatibility processing of the document for 
        them. On the other hand it seems natural that the user gets some kind of 
        message, especially where the ID-type is ID.
