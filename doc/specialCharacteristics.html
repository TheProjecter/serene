        The type conflict of most interest is that where two or more schema 
        definitions could apply to one document input occurrence in a certain 
        context. The different candidate definitions are processed parallely and
        are disqualified according to the errors they present. The terms used in 
        <B>Serene</B> to describe the conflict resolution state are:
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <P>
                    <B>resolved</B> when all the candidate definitions but one 
                    have been disqualified
                </P>
            <LI>
                <P>
                    <B>ambiguous</B> when there are several qualified candidates              
                </P>
            <LI>
                <P>
                    <B>unresolved</B> when all the candidates are disqualified

        The stages in the resolving of the an xml document occurrence with 
        respect to the corresponding RELAX NG schema patterns are:
        <BR>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                <P>
                    <B>initial matching</B> consists of the matching of an input element
                    or attribute's name to the name class corresponding to one of the 
                    definitions allowed by the schema in the respective context. Since 
                    characters definition patterns (text, data, value, list) do not 
                    have a name, in this stage, all the characters patterns defined 
                    within a context are considered a match. For all types of input, 
                    when no matches have been found, the input is interpreted as 
                    unexpected or unknown in the context. In <B>ambiguous</B> states
                    all candidates go to the next stage.
                </P>
            <LI>
                <P>
                    <B>pattern matching</B> consists of matching of a schema pattern 
                    to the corresponding occurrence in the document based on the 
                    content, this is done at the level of element definition pattern, 
                    attribute definition pattern, characters definition pattern 
                    (in <B>Serene</B> characters strings are considered to have a 
                    structure since some patterns may contain <CODE>group</CODE>,
                    <CODE>oneOrMore</CODE> etc). For improved message quality, it
                    takes place in two steps: first only errors of the immediate 
                    children are taken in account for disqualifying, if at the end 
                    of content validation ambiguity is still present, errors of 
                    the entire subtree are considered, this step favours an 
                    <B>ambiguous</B> over <B>unresolved</B> states. When, at the 
                    end, the resolution state is <B>unresolved</B>, all candidates 
                    go to the next stage. In <B>ambiguous</B> and <B>resolved</B> 
                    states, depending on the resolution strategy, either all 
                    candidates go to the next stage, or only the qualified ones.                    
                </P>
            <LI>
                <P>
                    <B>in context handling</B> consists of handling of an
                    occurrence as part of the parent's context.
                </P>
        </UL>
    </P>
    <P>
        With the <B>Serene 0.6</B> release, the integration of the conflict 
        resolution stages is introduced. This delays the error reporting until 
        the end of conflict handling and ensures that the different stages do not
        generate separate messages any more. The main improvement is for the 
        cases where after <B>pattern matching</B> the conflict is <B>unresolved</B>, 
        but the <B>in context handling</B> eventually resolves it to one 
        definition. In those cases the only error messages that get reported now 
        are those of the winner definition and the corresponding subtree, as 
        opposed to an unresolved content error message previously.
    </P>
    <P>
        When integrating the handling of element, attribute and list token 
        conflicts the strategy used is one that gives priority to the content 
        over context. For element character content and attribute value other 
        than list tokens the context has priority over content. When reporting 
        element conflict errors the richness of information is favoured, for 
        attribute, element character content and attribute value, which have a 
        much simpler structure, readability is favoured over richness of 
        information, so the details of the <B>pattern matching</B> errors are not 
        reported. Moreover, in the later cases, warnings are only issued for 
        trully <B>ambiguous</B> occurrences.

    <P>
        <B>Serene</B> attempts to deliver good, meaningful messages. In
        the same time it attempts to handle all messages, including error and
        warning messages resulted from the ambiguity and conflict handling,
        in a uniform and transparent way. Also the syntax validation for the
        schema documents and the validation of document syntax are handled
        transparently using exactly the same algorithm. 
    </P>
    <P>
        In order to achieve all this transparency, an approach was chosen
        where a distinction is made between the detection, interpretation and
        reporting of errors. This approach allows to group the messages
        produced by the disqualifying errors of different candidates during
        conflict handling and report them in the unresolved content error 
        messages. Another consequence of this approach is
        the fact that while error detection happens where the error is, 
        interpretation and reporting are delayed. The location information 
        passed to the <CODE>SAXParseException</CODE> is that of the place where 
        the error reporting is done. This is the end tag of the element in whose 
        context the error took place. For conflicts, the errors of the entire 
        subtree are reported at the end of the element in whose context the 
        conflict is. Location information regarding the exact place where the 
        error occurred is provided in the content of the message in a meaningful 
        way.
    </P>    
    <P>
        Using exactly the same algorithm for the syntax validation of both
        schemas and documents and, in the same time, trying to be meaningful
        means that the messages are always pointing to the rule that has been
        broken; that is a rule from the RELAX NG syntax specification in the
        case of schemas, and a pattern from the concerned schema in the case
        of documents.
